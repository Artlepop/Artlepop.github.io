            <h2>My group completed the Tortoise and Hare project. One problem we encountered was figuring out how to display the race as a static image instead of repeatedly printing the race over and over. We resolved this by implementing the replit.clear command into our code. This command cleared the screen and gave the illusion that the string was static. Another problem we had difficulty with was figuring out how to display the race as a whole. We decided to create two different functions. One would calculate the distances of the hare and the tortoise while the other would take the inputs of the hare and the tortoise and print out the race accordingly.</h2>
