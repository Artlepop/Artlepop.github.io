    when I graduate from college. I plan to major in computer science during college to achieve this goal.
    I want to be a Game Developer because I think that it would be a fun and entertaining job.<hr> I would descirbe myself as confident and diligent.
    I am the co-president of the Game Development Club at Palm Desert High school and have made many projects that you can check out <a class="hubblelink" href="https://hubble-wubble.itch.io/">here</a>.
    My most important achievements during high school would be learning c#, starting a club, and participating in a card board boat race. I have also participated in
    game jams which are competitions about making games.</h1></td>

    <h1 class = "paragraph">What I have learned during high school is to be resposible, hardworking, and a team player. My teachers taught me
    that I have to be responsible and hardworking if I want good grades and my club has taught me to be a team player and rely on others for help as well as help others.
